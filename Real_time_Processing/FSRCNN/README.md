# Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (FSRCNN) Overview

## Introduction
The Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (FSRCNN) is designed to enhance the resolution of images in real-time. It improves upon traditional super-resolution techniques by providing a faster and more efficient method to upscale low-resolution images while maintaining high quality.

## üåü Model Architecture
FSRCNN features an innovative architecture with several key layers designed to optimize performance:
1. **Feature Extraction Layer**: Utilizes small convolutional filters to capture primary features from low-resolution images.
2. **Shrinking Layer**: Reduces dimensionality to decrease computational complexity.
3. **Non-linear Mapping Layer**: Transforms features into a high-dimensional space to enhance complex textures and details.
4. **Expanding Layer**: Reverses the shrinking process to prepare features for the final reconstruction.
5. **Deconvolution Layer**: Also known as the upscaling layer, it reconstructs the high-resolution output from the processed features

## ‚ùì What is Super Resolution?
Super Resolution (SR) refers to the process of improving the resolution of an image from a lower resolution to a higher resolution. The core idea is to reconstruct the high-resolution details from a low-resolution image using advanced machine learning algorithms.
