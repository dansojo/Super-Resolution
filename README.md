## üåü Project Overview
This project aims to explore the capabilities of Super Resolution through deep learning by enhancing the quality of images from low to high resolution. It includes practical implementations of various state-of-the-art Super Resolution models, alongside in-depth documentation and examples to facilitate understanding and innovation in image processing techniques.

## ‚ùì What is Super Resolution?
Super Resolution (SR) refers to the process of improving the resolution of an image from a lower resolution to a higher resolution. The core idea is to reconstruct the high-resolution details from a low-resolution image using advanced machine learning algorithms.

### Key Concepts:
- **HR (High Resolution):** The detailed, high-quality version of an image.
- **LR (Low Resolution):** The degraded, lower-quality version of an image, typically with fewer pixels and less detail.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Background
Super Resolution techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: interpolation-based methods and learning-based methods.

### Interpolation-Based Methods:
These methods use mathematical formulas to estimate new pixel values based on the values of surrounding pixels. Common examples include nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolation.

### Learning-Based Methods:
These involve training deep neural networks, typically using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn the transformation from LR to HR images. These models are trained using pairs of LR and HR images and can generate more accurate and realistic images compared to interpolation methods.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**
- **LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)**
